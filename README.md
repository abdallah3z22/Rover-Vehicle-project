## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a fully functional rover vehicle controlled remotely using the **RemoteXY** mobile application and an **Arduino** board.  
The system includes:

- Real-time temperature and humidity sensing using **DHT11**.
- Obstacle distance measurement via **Ultrasonic Sensor** (HC-SR04).
- Movement control using a **joystick interface**.
- Servo motor control via slider.
- Sound alerts triggered by specific sensor states.
- Rocker-Bogie suspension system for rough terrain.
- 6 DC motors and 12 wheels for enhanced mobility and load balance.

### 🌍 Suggested Applications

 **🗿 Archaeological and Tourism Site Exploration**  
   Enables non-invasive monitoring of sensitive or restricted areas, such as Egypt’s *Siwa Oasis* and *Western Desert* archaeological zones.

 **🌾 Smart Agriculture in Arid Regions**  
   Assists in crop management by autonomously surveying fields, measuring soil moisture and temperature, and transmitting alerts to farmers via the app.

 **🚨 Disaster Response Operations**  
   Safely assesses hazardous environments, such as gas leaks or fire-prone zones, prior to human intervention — enhancing safety protocols.
