## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a fully functional rover vehicle controlled remotely using a mobile application and an **Arduino** board.  
The system includes:

- 🌡️ Real-time temperature and humidity sensing using **DHT11**.
- 📏 Obstacle distance measurement via **Ultrasonic Sensor** (HC-SR04).
- 🎮 Movement control using a **joystick interface**.
- 🎛️ Servo motor control via slider.
- 🔥🛑 Fire and gas detection sensors for enhanced safety monitoring.
- 🔔 Sound alerts triggered by specific sensor states.
- 🚙 Rocker-Bogie suspension system for rough terrain.
- ⚙️ 6 DC motors and 12 wheels for enhanced mobility and load balance.
- 📱 Intuitive mobile interface for real-time control and data monitoring.

## 🌍 Suggested Applications

 **🗿 Archaeological and Tourism Site Exploration**  
   Enables non-invasive monitoring of sensitive or restricted areas, such as Egypt’s *Siwa Oasis* and *Western Desert* archaeological zones.

 **🌾 Smart Agriculture in Arid Regions**  
   Assists in crop management by autonomously surveying fields, measuring soil moisture and temperature, and transmitting alerts to farmers via the app.

 **🚨 Disaster Response Operations**  
   Safely assesses hazardous environments, such as gas leaks or fire-prone zones, prior to human intervention — enhancing safety protocols.
